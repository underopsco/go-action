> GitHub Actions Toolkit for Go

### Goals

The goal is simple: provide a nice developer experience to people who want to author GitHub Actions
using Go while exploring how that experience can be improved.

### Features

- Functions for every [workflow command][workflow commands] (ex.: `action.GetInput()`, `action.SetInput()`)
- Easy access to the [GitHub Context][github context] (ex.: `action.Context.Token`, `action.Context.Ref`)
- Ready-to-use GitHub REST client (`action.REST`)
- Typed [events][events] (`action.GetEvent()`)
- _Experimental._ Automatic bindings of inputs and outputs (see [this example][example])

[workflow commands]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-commands-for-github-actions
[github context]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables#default-environment-variables
[events]: https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows
